# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a todo application that allows users to create, manage, and assign tasks to other users. The system enables collaborative task management where users can track their own tasks as well as tasks assigned to them by others. The application supports basic task operations (create, read, update, delete) with user assignment capabilities and appropriate access controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage my own tasks, so that I can organize my personal work and responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL store the task with a title, description, due date, and status
2. WHEN a user views their tasks THEN the system SHALL display all tasks they created or are assigned to
3. WHEN a user updates a task they own THEN the system SHALL save the changes and update the modification timestamp
4. WHEN a user deletes a task they own THEN the system SHALL remove the task from the system
5. WHEN a user marks a task as complete THEN the system SHALL update the task status to completed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to assign tasks to other users, so that I can delegate work and collaborate with team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a task THEN the system SHALL allow them to optionally assign it to another user
2. WHEN a user assigns a task to someone THEN the system SHALL notify the assignee of the new task
3. WHEN a task is assigned THEN the system SHALL record both the creator and assignee information
4. WHEN a user views assigned tasks THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between tasks they created and tasks assigned to them
5. IF a user is not the creator or assignee THEN the system SHALL NOT allow them to view or modify the task

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see tasks assigned to me by others, so that I can understand my responsibilities and complete delegated work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL display tasks assigned to them prominently
2. WHEN a user views their assigned tasks THEN the system SHALL show who created each task
3. WHEN a user completes an assigned task THEN the system SHALL notify the task creator
4. WHEN a user views task details THEN the system SHALL show the assignment history and current status
5. IF a task is overdue THEN the system SHALL highlight it with appropriate visual indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter and search my tasks, so that I can quickly find specific tasks or focus on particular categories of work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the task list THEN the system SHALL provide filters for status, assignee, and due date
2. WHEN a user searches for tasks THEN the system SHALL match against task titles and descriptions
3. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL update the task list in real-time
4. WHEN a user sorts tasks THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by due date, creation date, and priority
5. WHEN no tasks match the filter criteria THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage user accounts and authentication, so that tasks can be securely assigned and accessed only by authorized users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a unique user account with email and password
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate their credentials and create a session
3. WHEN a user assigns a task THEN the system SHALL only allow assignment to existing registered users
4. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL require valid authentication
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and display appropriate error messages
